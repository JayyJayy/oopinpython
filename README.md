# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

## About The Project
This project is a place for me to learn oop in python using Irv Kalb's book from the [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/operation-python-2022-software)

The code for which can be found on their repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/IrvKalb/Object-Oriented-Python-Code/)

I however will not be using the above repository as my learning process consists of following along and doing myself so iterations of this project will develop from being none OOP to being OOP.
